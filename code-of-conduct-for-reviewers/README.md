## The code of conduct for code reviewers

As stated before, commenting on someone else's code is also a human task, be nice to your fellow developers. Here are some pieces of advice, following them will highly decrease the chance that developers cry or throw chairs to each other in the office. (Just to mention, I have never seen the latter. So far...)

### Don'ts
* Don't refer to personal traits and don't judge (e.g. refer from saying you/your code is stupid...)
* Don't make demands (at least put there a please and explain why you ask for a change)
* Don't be sarcastic, even if you are buddies, other reviewers/readers might find some comments inappropriate
* Never say never, nor always. There will always be exceptions. So treat this rule with care...
* Avoid selective ownership of the code, i.e. don't use "mine", "not mine", "yours"...

### Dos
* Ask questions.
* Ask for clarification.
* Be explicit. Remember people don't always understand your intentions online.
* Seek to understand the author's perspective.
* If discussions turn too philosophical or academic, move the discussion offline 
* Identify ways to simplify the code while still solving the problem.
* Communicate which ideas you feel strongly about and those you don't. If you just express your preference, say that it's only your preference.
* Educate. If you suggest something, share proofs why it's better. Articles, studies, books, etc.
