The aim of this repository is to provide some guidelines to both for code reviewers and for those whose code is being reviewed.

In my opinion, reviewing code is at least as important as writing it in the first place. Reviewing someone else's code is a not just a technical task, it's also a human one. Human tasks are always delicate.

Let's start with the most important rule that you should always have in mind whenever you start to review a pull request or whenever you open up a review you received:

_**No comment should be personal. No comment should be made about the author or the reviewer. A review always must always be about the code!**_

The aim of a code review is to make the code better, to detect bugs before merging and delivering, and in addition, to improve maintainability of a given code base.

In this repository you will find guidelines mostly for the reviewers, but some for tha authors too. Some of the guidelines are technical, some are more like code of conducts.

Feel free to contribute to the repository. It will never be ready.
